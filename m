Hi Andy,

I've read it. It's not a split, it's a move. A move which makes sense
because, as explained in the commit message, module_init() is only
needed by modular code, so including it in init.h was slowing down the
pre-processing of non-modular code.

That being said, this alone does not imply that explicit inclusion of
both linux/init.h and linux/module.h in the same file is wrong. The
only case where this commit would directly lead to the removal of
#include <linux/init.h> from i2c-i801.c is if module_init() was the
only thing from linux/init.h that this driver was using. Which is not
the case, as I see various occurrences of __init and __exit left, and
these are declared in linux/init.h.

As a matter of fact I still count 3921 driver files which include both
linux/init.h and linux/module.h. And I see no comment in either header
file that including one exempts you from including the other.

So I'm not taking this change, sorry. If this is really the direction
you want us to take (and I'm not convinced, but my opinion does not
necessarily matter), then it must be documented first, and I believe it
should then be addressed tree-wide. 3921 individual commits do not seem
to be the most efficient to get it done.
