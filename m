Hum, I see.

In my use case, I don't use MFD drivers but only simple-bus compatible.
I think your point is also relevant with simple-bus. Indeed how does a
parent bus driver know if there is a specific bus driver that handles
the child simple-bus compatible one in case of 'simple-bus' used as
fallback.

Related to your proposal related to the "list of devices with a driver",
what do you mean? I don't see how to set this kind of list. Can you give
me some pointers?

If I understood the discussion, the issue seems that 'simple-bus' can't
populate unconditionally children at his probe. The possible recursion
in creating devices done by of_platform_populate() should be kept and
'simple-bus' should rely on that.

The other solution that fixes my use case is to use an other compatible
string. Would you accept a new compatible string: "simple-platform-bus"?

In simple-pm-bus.c, this compatible would populate children at probe.
In fact, it will act the same way as 'simple-pm-bus' without looking at
clocks nor handling pm_runtime.

Best regards,
HervÃ©
