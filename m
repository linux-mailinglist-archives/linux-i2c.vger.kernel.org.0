Hi Liang,

I'm very impressed Rockchip is pushing patches so early, thanks a lot!

See below.

I agree with having a rk3566.dtsi, and rk3568.dtsi on top, instead of the
other way around. We have some RK3566 boards here, so we can surely test
the RK3566.dtsi patches very quickly.

Also, it's fine if you want to send v2 with just these minimal peripherals.
However, I think you could include GMAC and TS-ADC:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-rockchip/20210421203409.40717-1-ezequiel@collabora.com/T/#t

These should work right out of the box!

Thanks!
Ezequiel
