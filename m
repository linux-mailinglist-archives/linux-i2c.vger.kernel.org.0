You can't directly. The rise time is a function of the capacitive
loading on the lines and the pull-up resistor. It's not a software
parameter.

This makes me convinced that you're not familiar with electronics.

Vil is a pretty standard parameter in all digital logic for "Voltage,
input, low" - the voltage at which it is guaranteed that the device
will see a logic 0 signal on its input.

If I draw a diagram illustrating the voltage levels on an input,
top is the supply voltage, bottom is ground, then most are:

	+------+	<--- Vcc (supply voltage)
	|      |	<--- Within this region, it is guaranteed that
	|      |	     the device will see a logic 1
	+------+	<--- Vih (input high)
	|//////|
	|\\\\\\|	<--- Within this region, the value that the
	|//////|	     device sees is indeterminant
	|\\\\\\|
	+------+	<--- Vil (input low)
	|      |
	|      |
	+------+	<--- Ground (0V)

So, if the voltage on the SDA and SCL pins does not reach Vil or below,
there is no guarantee that the device will see a logic 0 on its input,
and it either won't work, it may sporadically work. Basically, Vil is
the threshold voltage at which the manufacturer _guarantees_ that the
device will see a logic 0, and Vih is the threshold voltage at which
the manufacturer _guarantees_ that the device will see a logic 1.

Both these parameters will be specified in the data sheet, possibly
as a function of supply voltage.

Which means either the device is not seeing the logic levels necessary
to receive the address, or maybe if this is a prototype I2C device,
maybe it has a bug in its address matching logic, or the address is
incorrectly set.

I'd first be checking that the Vih and Vil for this device are being
achieved by putting an oscilloscope on its input pin and comparing
that with the device specification.
