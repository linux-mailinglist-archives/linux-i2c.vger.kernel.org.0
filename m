That's the wrong clock frequency.  I believe that property is the i2c bus clock
frequency Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i2c/i2c.txt 
The one being used here is the input clock.  I'd imagine there is some division
done, but probably doesn't make sense to represent that using the clock framework
as the i2c bus clock signal isn't directly derived from the input clock
(pulse stretching and all sorts of other fun in I2C).  Also massive overkill
given no one else can use this clock.

I'd rather provide the clock from ACPI using Niyas' stuff when ready -
it looks like a promising general solution so don't want to put an
partial solution in before that.

I kept these two changes in the last patch as I suspect they are the
ones that can be considered a hack, given we don't actually have a
real platform using ACPI with this device.  Anyone on aspeed know if
anyone cares about ACPI on those BMCs?
