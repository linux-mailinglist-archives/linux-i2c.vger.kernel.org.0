Subject: [PATCH] i2c: enable async suspend/resume on i2c devices

This enables the async suspend property for i2c devices. This reduces
the suspend/resume time considerably on platforms with multiple i2c
devices (such as a trackpad or touchscreen).

This patch was originally created for chromeos some time ago and I'm
evaluating if it's a good candidate for upstreaming.

By the looks of it I think it was done with chromebooks in mind, but
AFAICT this would impact every i2c client in every platform, so I'd like
to know your opinion about it.

As far as I know there was no further investigation or testing on it, so
I don't know if it was tested on any other hardware.

Best,
Ricardo
