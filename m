I think that manual probing after user confirmation is acceptable. But
automatic one without any user confirmation after kernel upgrade for all
existing and also all future machines is not something which I can say
that is safe.

I have experience when broken bytes in EDID eeprom and monitor
completely stopped working. It was after manual probing of some eeprom
driver (so driver of the correct class). If kernel/X11 logs did not
print warnings about EDID checksum I would not be able to debug & repair
it.

So one can be really unlucky if something happen in the future, like
changing laptop board wiring, changing accelerator chipset or whatever.

I have also experience with i2c device which have broken first i2c
single byte read (first after wakeup from low power state) and product
errata was to put data line to some position for at least some period of
time before doing the real data transfer.

I rather do not want to image what can happen if similar hw bug is in
the i2c multiplexer after which are connected more i2c devices...

After those experiences I want to be really safe about what is kernel
going to do automatically after the boot.

Hiding all above logic behind module parameter which is disabled by
default sounds safe. I think that this is something against which should
not be too much disagreements (expecting that module parameter will have
correct description with warning, just to be safe).

But well, my guess is that people would like to see accelerometer to
work out-of-the-box without configuring anything.

And this is possible only by communication with Dell. Dell designers
should have some ideas how it is suppose to work. And reinventing the
wheel from scratch in Linux kernel is not the best option.
