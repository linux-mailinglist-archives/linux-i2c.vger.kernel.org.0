But description from modinfo -p and neither parameter name itself does not.
And neither no kernel message when the parameter was enabled.

And what do you think, that if you send tons of long emails with C code
to lot of recipients and add a carbon copy of all those your emails to
some corporate group address, that somebody on that group address will
read every one paragraph of every your email and tries to detect in if
there is not hidden some question to which you want to know answer?
No, with this behavior you are going to be put on the corporate
spam list by automated systems.

This looks like you just wanted to mark your personal checkbox
"I sent email to some dell address" and let it as is.

In past when I sent private email to dell I normally received responses.
Also they said to me that group address is (or at that time was)
monitored.

So it would be nice to start communication with dell and figure out what
is the current state of smbus address detection via ACPI/WMI/DMI/whatever,
instead of adding this hacks via poking of smbus addresses.

And in case the mentioned group address does not work anymore there are
still other linux developers from dell who could be able to figure
something out.
