I'm sorry, I have missed that. With that modification it should be 
(theoretically - haven't tested it yet) possible to use our v4l2 driver 
with this XDMA driver instead of the one I have provided in my patches.

I will now try to rewrite our driver and test it with your XDMA driver 
to be sure it works. It will however definitely need a "V4" of your XDMA 
driver with that patch on github before it can be included into the 
kernel and be usable for all XDMA-based PCIe cards.
