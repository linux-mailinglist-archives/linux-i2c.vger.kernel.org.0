Subject: [PATCH] i2c: mv64xxx: Fix random system lock caused by runtime PM
Date:   Thu,  8 Apr 2021 04:00:00 +0200

I noticed a weird bug with this driver on Marvell CN9130 Customer
Reference Board.

Sometime after boot, the system locks with the following message:
 [104.071363] i2c i2c-0: mv64xxx: I2C bus locked, block: 1, time_left: 0

The system does not respond afterwards, only warns about RCU stalls.

This first appeared with commit e5c02cf54154 ("i2c: mv64xxx: Add runtime
PM support").

With further experimentation I discovered that adding a delay into
mv64xxx_i2c_hw_init() fixes this issue. This function is called before
every xfer, due to how runtime PM works in this driver. It seems that in
order to work correctly, a delay is needed after the bus is reset in
this function.

Since there already is a known erratum with this controller needing a
delay, I assume that this is just another place this needs to be
applied. Therefore I apply the delay only if errata_delay is true.
