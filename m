Hi Bartosz,

Thanks for your swift review.

I think this is the first time someone asks me to use the ternary
operator in the name of readability :-D

FWIW the !(flags & FLAG) construct is very popular among kernel
developers, with over 8500 occurrences in the kernel tree, and I
personally find it more readable. As a matter of fact, the very at24
driver already uses that construct a few lines before I do:

	writable = !(flags & AT24_FLAG_READONLY);

which is why I did the same. I tend to think that consistency matters
when it comes to code readability.

That being said, you are maintaining the at24 driver, so I'll do as you
prefer.

OK, makes sense. There is no dependency so they can take their own
route to upstream and land there in whatever order. However the bug
won't be fixed until both are committed.
