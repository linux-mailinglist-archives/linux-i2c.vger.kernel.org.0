No, it does not have to. We solved it numerous time with quirks or
per-chip-drvdata. It's common.

I understand it is part of the architecture but why Nuvoton is different
than other architectures and requires special treatment here? With most
of the drivers, regardless of possibility of running same build on
different hardware, we strive to make it ifdef-independent.

Please run:
  git grep ARCH -- drivers/i2c/busses/*c
and see how many of such ifdef patterns you see. You also won't find
them if you grep for CONFIG...

The driver should be designed in portable way. The driver should not
have architecture-dependent code.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
