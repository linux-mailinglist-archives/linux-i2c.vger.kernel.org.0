Documentation/hwmon/ltc4286.rst is expected in this patch and not as
part of the bindings. The bindings do not document the driver,
they document the chip bindings.

No, it has not.

ltc2487 is _not_ ltc4287.
    ^^               ^^

Sure, a Google search for LTC4287 returns a link to LTC2487 (!) as first response,
but LTC2487 is an ADC and has nothing but the manufacturer in common with LTC4286.

LTC4286 High Power Positive Hot-Swap Controller with Power Monitor via PMBus
LTC2487 16-Bit 2-/4-Channel ∆Σ ADC with PGA, Easy Drive and I2C Interface

I _really_ do not understand what you are trying to do here or why.

"info" is a pointer to a static variable.

	info = &ltc4286_info;
	
In this context, what you are saying above does not make sense. The
second chip's configuration will override the first chip's configuration.

	info->m[PSC_POWER] = 4 * rsense;
	...


No, sorry, this still does not make sense.

Please read my comment. I am saying that it does not make sense to provide the chip ID
to i2c_device_id but not in of_device_id. Either add it do both if needed or not at
all. I am not telling which one, I am just asking for consistency.

However, as mentioned earlier, according to your code the chips supposedly have identical
functionality. Separate chip IDs (ltc4286 and ltc4287) therefore seem unnecessary (not
even counting the fact that ltc4287 still does not seem to exist).
