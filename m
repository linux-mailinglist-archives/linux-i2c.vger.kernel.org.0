The new issue pointed out by Volker is independent from the bug being
fixed here. We do want these 2 patches applied now, with the 1st one
being stable material. The second patch is only a clean-up so it
doesn't need to go to stable.

This new issue exists since April 2018. I'm surprised it wasn't
reported as a regression earlier. Maybe newer BIOSes are getting better
at not making assumptions about register states at suspend time (let me
dream!) Anyway, it deserves its own fix, which also qualifies for
stable in my opinion.
