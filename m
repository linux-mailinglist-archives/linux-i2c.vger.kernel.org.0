Hello.

Thanks for the update. It looks good as a separate driver. I had 
intended to split this driver, replace polling with interrupts, and 
convert all I/O calls to MMIO, similar to how a Windows driver operates. 
I paused the work because I needed documentation and fixes from other 
companies, and I resolved my issue using a different approach:

- I have not received a response from Synaptics.
- I have not received a response from Lenovo.
- I have fixed the original issue - 
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-input/patch/71d9dc66-9576-c26f-c9d9-129217f50255@gmail.com/#24848525
- Too many subsystems are affected, some of which are currently hardly 
fixable.

The biggest issue is interrupt support, which cannot be resolved with 
quirks alone.

My device has this DSDT ACPI entry:

 Â Name (_HID, "SMB0001")Â  // _HID: Hardware ID
 Â Name (_CRS, ResourceTemplate ()Â  // _CRS: Current Resource Settings
 Â {
 Â Â Â Â  IO (Decode16,
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  0x0B20,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  // Range Minimum
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  0x0B20,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  // Range Maximum
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  0x20,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  // Alignment
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  0x20,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  // Length
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  )
 Â Â Â Â  IRQ (Level, ActiveLow, Shared, )
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  {7}
 Â })

This entry defines the IRQ number, trigger, and polarity. However, the 
kernel ignores this entry and only uses the "Interrupt Source Override" 
from the MADT table. Here are some potential solutions:

- Scan ACPI for interrupts and include them in overrides
 Â  - Scanning might break or fix many drivers. This is a significant 
change that could affect numerous buggy BIOS ACPI implementations.

- Change the interrupt trigger and polarity on the fly in the ASF driver
 Â  - The interrupt trigger cannot be changed with irq_set_type because 
it lacks an ioapic_ir_chip.irq_set_type implementation

- Implement a new quirk or hook to modify interrupts
 Â  - This would involve extending the quirk system to allow changes to 
polarity/trigger before APIC initialization.

- Add the missing MADT table
 Â  - Lenovo ignores this requirement.

Fixing this bug might break trackpoint support on ThinkPads, as the 
Synaptics firmware does not behave as described in the documentation.

Given the high potential for system instability with minimal gain, my 
requested feature may not be worth pursuing.

I can maybe help with testing this new ASF driver on older hardware 
without specific ACPI ID.
