Based on discussion I think the delayed solution is most suited if 
implemented in ICC core because other ICC client might face the similar 
problem.

However for geni case I am more inclined towards below proposed solution.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How about if we expose an API from common driver(geni-se) for putting QUP
core BW vote to 0.

We call this from console probe just after uart_add_one_port call (console
resources are enabled as part of this call) to put core quota to 0 on behalf
of earlyconsole?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think below are the pros and cons for above solution.

Pros:

1) Not only it'll solve the current issue also it'll lay foundation to 
support earlyconsole without having a real console. In future if needed 
we can enable rest of the earlyconsole resources(SE clocks) from common 
driver to make it independent of real console.

2) Inorder to solve bug:120934049(Add runtime PM support to common 
driver and move enablement/disablement of AHB clocks there) reported by 
Stephen Boyd, we'll end up adding ICC support to this driver because as 
per HPG the order of enabling the QUP clocks should be 
(Core-->AHB-->SE(per engine)). So we need to have the minimal possible 
vote on QUP core before enabling AHB clocks.

I agree still we have keep earlycon fix as it is(vote from common driver 
probe and remove once real console is up) .

I mentioned above bug in case it seems silly to add ICC support to 
common driver just for earlyconsole fix.

Cons:

1) As Evan mentioned and I agree that the whole house of cards comes 
down if we replace these votes in the wrong order. But I think this is 
very unlikely to happen once fixed.

2) As Matthias mentioned we are voting for all the QUPs regardless 
earlycon is present or not, I think this is HW limitation and we have to 
live with it.

Even if I try something like below the QUP1 can come up before 
QUP2(console) and child of QUP1 can remove vote from share QUP clocks.

if (of_get_compatible_child(pdev->dev.of_node, "qcom,geni-debug-uart")) {

 Â Â Â  ret = icc_set_bw(wrapper->icc_path_geni_to_core, Bps_to_icc(1000),

 Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Bps_to_icc(1000));

}


Thanks,

Akash
