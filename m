Hi Brendan, Thanks for sharing your thought.

Hi Rob,

I'm bringing it back to make progress again. Like Brendan said, I also
prefer sticking to a single mode which is selected through device tree
and it would be right way for enabling all features this hardware
provides. There would be no big benefit if we make dynamic mode change
for 'byte' and 'buf' modes based on transaction size because 'buf' mode
can effectively cover the small transaction size cases well without
making a performance degradation. Means that we can remove the 'byte'
mode but I don't want to hide/block a feature which this hardware
originally provides.

Please let us know your thought.

Thanks,
Jae
