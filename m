Hi All,

This is version 2 of my series previously titled:
"[PATCH 00/13] power-suppy/i2c/extcon: Add support for cht-wc PMIC
without USB-PD support".

So far almost all the kernel code surrounding the Cherry Trail Whiskey Cove
PMIC has been developed on the GPD win / pocket devices and it has various
assumption based on that. In the mean time I've learned (and gotten access
to) about 2 more designs and none of the 3 now known designs use a single
standard setup for the charger, fuel-gauge and other chips surrounding the
PMIC / charging+data USB port:

1. The GPD Win and GPD Pocket mini-laptops, these are really 2 models
but the Pocket re-uses the GPD Win's design in a different housing:

The WC PMIC is connected to a TI BQ24292i charger, paired with
a Maxim MAX17047 fuelgauge + a FUSB302 USB Type-C Controller +
a PI3USB30532 USB switch, for a fully functional Type-C port.

2. The Xiaomi Mi Pad 2:

The WC PMIC is connected to a TI BQ25890 charger, paired with
a TI BQ27520 fuelgauge, using the TI BQ25890 for BC1.2 charger type
detection, for a USB-2 only Type-C port without PD.

3. The Lenovo Yoga Book YB1-X90 / Lenovo Yoga Book YB1-X91 series:

The WC PMIC is connected to a TI BQ25892 charger, paired with
a TI BQ27542 fuelgauge, using the WC PMIC for BC1.2 charger type
detection and using the BQ25892's Mediatek Pump Express+ (1.0)

###

Unlike what is normal on X86 this diversity in designs is not handled /
abstracted away by the ACPI tables.

This series takes care of making sure that charging and device/host mode
switching also works on the Xiaomi Mi Pad 2 and the Lenovo Yogabook.

New in version 2 of this patch-set:
- This is all about Whiskey Cove based designs, instead of going roundabout
  and (ab)using drivers/platform/x86/touchscreen_dmi.c to add
  device-properties on the WC I2C-dev and then check for that, just add a new
  intel_cht_wc_get_model() helper to the intel_soc_pmic_chtwc.c MFD-driver.
- Extend the series to not only fix things on the Mi Pad 2, but also on the
  Lenovo Yogabook YB1-X90*/-X91* models.

Patches  1-13: Prepare the bq25890 power_supply driver to fully support
               the Mi Pad 2 and the Yogabook
               Note this includes a new version of the 3 bq25890 cleanup /
               fixes patches send earlier by Yauhen Kharuzhy
Patch 14:      Adds the intel_cht_wc_get_model() helper
Patch 15:      Uses this intel_cht_wc_get_model() value to instantiate an
               i2c-client with the right type and properties for the charger
               IC used on the board (instead of harcoding the GPD values)
Patches 16-20: Modify the extcon code to provide charger-detection results
               to the charger driver and to take care of the Vbus boost
               regulator control (for host-mode) and device/host mode
               switching

I've tried to keep the power_supply patches as generic as possible while
focussing some of the special handling these boards need in the
WC PMIC MFD and cell drivers, which will only get loaded on these boards.

Since some of the later patches depend on some of the power_supply changes;
and since the Whiskey Cove MFD and cell drivers generally do not see much
changes I believe that it would be best to merge the entire series through
Sebastian's linux-power-supply tree.

Lee, Wolfram and Chanwoo, may we please have your Ack for merging this
entire series through Sebastian's linux-power-supply tree?

Regards,

Hans
