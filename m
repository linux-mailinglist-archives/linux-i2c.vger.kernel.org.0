Sorry, this is probably my bad. The first ASCII-art which I posted is
how things actually work in HW. The second one is how I assumed that
things would look like in some nested representation of the IRQ-domains
given that all the IRQs mentioned in the ASCII-art now use the same fwnode
as parent for their domain. But poking around in sysfs I don't see any
hierarchical representation of the domains at all. Actually I cannot
find any representation of the IRQ domains inside sysfs (I've never
looked at / into this before) ?

If what you say is right and the fwnode is only used to set a name (where can
I see those names ?) then your patch is probably correct.

There already is a regmap IRQ chip associated with the MFD device and the
IRQ handling required here is somewhat tricky (see the comments in the driver)
so I would prefer to keep this as is.

More testing is always welcome :)   With that said, testing these changes really
is not a lot of work for me.
