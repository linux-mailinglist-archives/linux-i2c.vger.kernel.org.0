That is a big problem if there is no replacement. The primary usage of
that hardware and all these drivers is that freefall ability. It was
originally written for HP laptops and later extended for Dell. Access to
accelerometer axes was just a secondary functions for linux fans.

Userspace tool is directly in the kernel tree. Somewhere in tools dir
now as it was moved (if it was not removed).

I guess nobody ported it to these tools. IIRC the freefall design comes
from the Suse the tool was also used on preloaded HP laptops. So maybe
Suse have custom tool? I do not know.
