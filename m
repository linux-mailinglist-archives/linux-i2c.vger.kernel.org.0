Hmm,Â  BCM threshold to CORE2X clock rate mapping is exposed to us from 
clock team.

BCM threshold value is internally convert to mentioned clock rate this 
is something internal to board ICC driver.

Yes, this is correct as the core clocks behaves different than any other 
NOC, we rely on the recommendation from VI/HW team.

I am not sure whether they intend to say this.

Ok,
