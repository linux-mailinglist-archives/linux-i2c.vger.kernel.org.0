Adding EPROBE_DEFER just complicates the dependency and state model.
I would really suggest to come up with a simpler solution, not too
complicated where it is required to think a lot if is is correct and if
all edge-cases are handled.

Well, rmmod & modprobe is not the rare cases. Whatever developers say
about rmmod (or modprobe -r or whatever is the way for unloading
modules), this is something which is used by a lot of users and would be
used.

I'm not sure if it belongs to "SMO88xx ACPI platform_device" but for
sure I agree with you that it does not belong to i801 code. I would say
that it belongs to some SMO8800 glue code -- because it is not the
classic ACPI driver too. But I'm not against to have SMO glue code and
SMO ACPI driver in one file (maybe it is even better to have it).

I think we can take an assumption that ACPI SMO device does not change
it existence or ACPI enabled/disabled state during runtime. So we can
scan for ACPI SMO device just once in function stored in __init section
called during the kernel/module initialization and cache the result
(bool if device was found + its i2c address). After function marked as
__init finish its job then together with DMI tables can be discarded
from RAM. With this way it does take extra memory on every x86 system.
Also we can combine this with an SMO config option, so the whole code
"glue" code would not be compiled when SMO driver is not enabled via
Kconfig.

I think alternative approach which I described in the other email in
this thread could be useful for this issue too (to move SMO code from
i2c-i801.c source file). Together with above __init section approach it
can also decrease memory usage.

This is something about which I'm not very convinced. IIO st_accel
driver does not support freefall interface (or any other for signalling
hard disk falls, which is used by userspace) and in dell systems, this
hard disk protection is the primary usage of the accelerometer.

In last two months I talked with two people, users of the accelerometers
axis on dell and thinkpad machines. They were using it in games which
were joystick-based (one game was tuxracer, second I do not remember
name).

So I'm not sure that replacing joystick driver by some new API would be
really useful for users of accelerometer axis.

Before such change I would propose to teach IIO st_accel driver (or what
would be the replacement) to support joystick API for userspace.

I understand this problem.

But I would like to ask a question: WHY it is needed at all?
The IRQ represents the free fall / hard disk fall event, which is
slightly different thing than reporting accelerometer axis.
Why IIO st_accel (or lis3lv02d) needs free fall IRQ?

Hard disk fall interrupt on Dell machines can be handled by separate
driver, not related to ACPI SMO8800 device.

It would be much more easier to split these two different
functionalities (reporting axes; and reporting hard disk fall event)
into two separate drivers. And it would simplify whole logic related to
instantiating free fall hard disk driver and accelerometer axes driver
(either IIO st_accel or lis3lv02d or some other...).

So from my side, I do not see a reason to "inject" IRQ number into
driver which reads accelerometer axes.

I agree, that it does not belong to the i2c-i801.c source file. And I
also would like to see movement. That is why I proposed alternative and
simpler solution.
