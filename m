The main reason is to avoid yellow bang in Windows. But the consequences of
this are the untested configurations in case it's always enabled and unhidden.

Yeah, I rephrased this as

  "...the least significant bits of the base address register which is
  represented by the only 64-bit BAR0."

I believe more about this is discussed below (1).

So, you are repeating what I told you when you asked me why we read a BAR
of another device. I put it here to avoid again the same question from you
or anyone else (who may well be not familiar with the spec).

What do you want me to do here?

It's not me, the documentation, but yes, something like you provided above
is what it does.

Yes, thanks, I fixed as suggested.

(1)

Correct and the P2SB area is not included there.

Yes, and again the purpose of this paragraph is to document the background
of all these as requested by you in previous round. It might be I misread
what you wanted that time.

Exactly. And I believe this explains why the region is excluded from _CRS and
why we mustn't reallocate it. It probably will work (again, no-one have broadly
tested this), but it will consume resources which can be used by others (like
Thunderbolt).

Intel FirmWare Image, I will spell it in full.

What do you mean? The unhide/hide back has been tested and we have
already users in the kernel (they have other issues though with the
PCI rescan lock, but it doesn't mean it wasn't ever tested).

What purposes do you have in mind?

I do not follow what you are implying here.

As you see the code, it's not a driver, it's a library that reuses PCI
functions because the hardware is represented by an IP inside PCI hierarchy
and with PCI programming interface.

No it's not (at least on all platforms what I know of). We are good here.

Are you going to fix all firmwares and devices on the market?
We have it's done like this and unfortunately we can't fix what's
is done due to users who won't update their firmwares by one or
another reason.

Sorry, I do not follow you. The device is PCI, but it's taken out of PCI
subsystem control by this hardware trick.
