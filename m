The fact that BIOS hid the BAR is a good hint that BIOS doesn't want
us to touch it.

You say the "least significant part of the *address space*" -- I don't
know what that would be, unless you mean the least-significant bits of
a *BAR*.

The general rule is that the OS is allowed to reassign BARs unless the
firmware tells us otherwise via the "Preserve PCI Boot Configuration"
_DSM.

I'm not familiar with the rule that the least-significant bits of a
BAR being hardwired to zero means the OS must not reallocate the BAR.
Per spec, the least-significant bits being hardwired to zero is what
tells us the *size* of the BAR.

This doesn't sound interesting; it sounds like standard PCI behavior.
Per PCIe r5.0, sec 7.5.1.1.9, "When [Multi-Function Device is] Clear,
software must not probe for Functions other than Function 0 unless
explicitly indicated by another mechanism, such as an ARI or SR-IOV
Extended Capability structure."

So software can't probe for functions other than 0 unless function 0
is present and has the Multi-Function Device bit set.

Is this P2SB thing function 0?

Are you saying it works like this?

  pci_read_config_word  (p2sb_dev, PCI_VENDOR_ID, &id);	# id = 0x8086
  pci_write_config_dword(p2sb_dev, 0xe0, HIDE);
  pci_read_config_word  (p2sb_dev, PCI_VENDOR_ID, &id);	# id = 0xffff
  pci_write_config_dword(p2sb_dev, 0xe0, ~HIDE);
  pci_read_config_word  (p2sb_dev, PCI_VENDOR_ID, &id);	# id = 0x8086

"In order to prevent OS from the assignment to these addresses"
doesn't read quite right.  Is it supposed to say something about
"preventing the OS from assigning these addresses"?

When assigning space to PCI devices, the OS is only allowed to use
space from the host bridge _CRS.

Is the above supposed to say that the firmware omits a region from the
host bridge _CRS to prevent the OS from using it?  That's the standard
behavior, of course.

And, of course, if the OS cannot enumerate a PCI device, obviously it
cannot reassign any BARs on this device it doesn't know about.

Ah, OK, maybe this is seeping in.  Tell me if I'm understanding
correctly:

  - P2SB is a device connected via PCI that has one BAR
  - Firmware programs the BAR to [mem 0xd0000000-0xd0ffffff]
  - Firmware sets the P2SB HIDE bit
  - P2SB now returns ~0 to config reads, handles config writes
    normally, and handles MMIO reads/writes normally
  - Firmware ensures [mem 0xd0000000-0xd0ffffff] is not available to
    the OS by removing it from _CRS and marking it "RESERVED" in e820
    or EFI memory map
  - P2SB returns ~0 to subsequent config reads
  - Therefore, OS cannot enumerate P2SB

Now you want to know the BAR value (0xd0000000) so you can do
something with it, so you clear the HIDE bit, read the BAR,
and set the HIDE bit again.

No clue what "IFWI" means.

The hardware and BIOS went to some trouble to hide this MMIO space
from the OS, but now the OS wants to use it.  I'm pretty sure the
systems were never tested against *that* configuration either :)

And the fact that they went to all this trouble to hide it means
the BIOS is likely using it for its own purposes and the OS may cause
conflicts if it also uses it.

The way the BIOS has this set up, P2SB is logically not a PCI device.
It is not enumerable.  The MMIO space it uses is not in the _CRS of a
PCI host bridge.  That means it's now a platform device.

Hopefully P2SB is not behind a PCI-to-PCI bridge that *is* under OS
control, because the OS might change the bridge apertures so the MMIO
space is no longer reachable.

The correct way to use this would be as an ACPI device so the OS can
enumerate it and the firmware can mediate access to it.  Going behind
the back of the firmware does not sound advisable to me.

If you want to hack something in, I think it might be easier to treat
this purely as a platform device instead of a PCI device.  You can
hack up the config accesses you need, discover the MMIO address, plug
that in as a resource of the platform device, and go wild.  I don't
think the PCI core needs to be involved at all.

Reverse engineering notes?  Nice, but not really what I would expect
to see in patches coming from INTEL to enable some INTEL hardware.

> [2]: https://lab.whitequark.org/files/gpioke/Intel-332690-004EN.pdf

An Intel datasheet (good) but from a non-Intel site (not so good).

> [3]: https://lab.whitequark.org/files/gpioke/Intel-332691-002EN.pdf

Again?  Use an intel.com link if you can.

If these support something in the commit log above, can you make the
connection a little clearer?  I guess one of these has a section
3.1.39?

> [4]: https://medium.com/@jacksonchen_43335/bios-gpio-p2sb-70e9b829b403

Are these notes on reverse engineering this thing?  Doesn't really
seem like useful information in this one.
