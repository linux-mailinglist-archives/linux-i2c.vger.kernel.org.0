So the generic recovery decided to set the pinmux state before calling
devm_gpiod_get(), where as the driver (and my code) originally did this
after calling devm_gpiod_get():

-       /*
-        * Claiming GPIOs can change the pinmux state, which confuses the
-        * pinctrl since pinctrl's idea of the current setting is unaffected
-        * by the pinmux change caused by claiming the GPIO. Work around that
-        * by switching pinctrl to the GPIO state here. We do it this way to
-        * avoid glitching the I2C bus.
-        */
-       pinctrl_select_state(i2c->pinctrl, i2c->pinctrl_recovery);
-
-       return pinctrl_select_state(i2c->pinctrl, i2c->pinctrl_default);

I'd suggest re-implementing my original scheme in the generic code
because this _does_ work on Armada 3720 hardware.

Removing the pinmux frobbing is likely to break stuff.
