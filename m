Okay, probably we can correct clients vote for their own bandwidth or 
reserve some minimum BW from interconnect platform driver is case of any 
latency issue observed.

I will drop this change in next version.

Will it create any difference ifÂ  peak_bw = 0 instead of peak_bw = 
avg_bw? In my understanding peak_bw <= avg_bw is no-ops, it won't impact 
the NOC speed.
