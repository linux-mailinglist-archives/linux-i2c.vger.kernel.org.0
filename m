Yeah, I suggested that in the past on a commit title of your patch not
on a commit message body. Anyway, it's not a strict rule.

Okay, Using of abstract functions would be a better way to simplify it.
Will update it in the next spin.

No. Will do that later using a separate commit.

Loading modules at the same time? This driver just enables the bit. It
doesn't have a bit clearing code so it would be safe even in that case.

Actually, I2C SRAM doesn't need to be disabled, means that the SRAM can
be left as enabled for all xfer modes. It's an unnecessary control so
Aspeed removed this register setting in AST2600 after enabling the SRAM
always by default.

It's a global setting which affects all busses so it can be set just
once. Since we don't need to clear the bit, each bus driver enables the
bit without checking the bit that is simple way.
