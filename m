This looks better but it is still the same approach - embedding ifdefs
to control the code flow and logic. Only naming is different. Whenever
you come with new I2C block for old or new architecture, you will have
the same problem. We solved such problems this already - quirks or
per-chip-drvdata - so here should be the same.

Even if the code does not end up in the same binary, it should be
designed properly. Because in the future it might end-up in same binary.

Everyone thought there will be no multiplatform ARMv7 so entire
arch/arm/mach-* was written exactly like that. And what? It was a lot of
effort to all of us to fix that mistakes. ARMv8 can work in 32-bit, so
who knows... Just do it properly.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
