Hi Cezar,

I think your first email reached everyone.

First of all, welcome to the community, any effort is
appreciated.

Start small: one file at a time. Some files are affected by
different kind of checkpatch issues, split them in separate
patches.

Before sending a patch make sure that everything builds (if it
doesn't maintainers don't like it) and that checkpatch doesn't
provide errors and warnings.

Woflram asked you how you tested your changes and this is the
major challenge. On one hand I can accept obvious changes, but
for major refactorings, I will require the changes to be tested.
I'm sure you can ask for help for further testing on some
drivers.

Finally make sure you have skimmed through the guidelines:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/process/submitting-patches.html
https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelHacking
https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1855.txt

The latter tells how to properly write email.

Andi
