Geert, Uwe,

Hopefully the following does a better job of explaining the two parameters?

Thanks,
Conor.

microchip,sync-update-mask:
   description: |
     Depending on how the IP is instantiated, there are two modes of
     operation. In synchronous mode, all channels are updated at the
     beginning of the PWM period, and in asynchronous mode updates
     happen as the control registers are written. A 16 bit wide
     "SHADOW_REG_EN" parameter of the IP core controls whether
     synchronous mode is possible for each channel, and is set by the
     bitstream programmed to the FPGA. If the IP core is instantiated
     with SHADOW_REG_ENx=1, both registers that control the duty cycle
     for channel x have a second "shadow"/buffer reg synthesised.
     At runtime a bit wide register exposed to APB can be used to toggle
     on/off synchronised mode for all channels it has been synthesised
     for.
     Each bit corresponds to a PWM channel & represents whether
     synchronous mode is possible for that channel.

   $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
   default: 0

microchip,dac-mode-mask:
   description: |
     Optional, per-channel Low Ripple DAC mode is possible on this IP
     core. It creates a minimum period pulse train whose High/Low
     average is that of the chosen duty cycle. This "DAC" will have far
     better bandwidth and ripple performance than the standard PWM
     algorithm can achieve. A 16 bit DAC_MODE module parameter of the IP
     core, set at instantiation and by the bitstream programmed to the
     FPGA, determines whether a given channel operates in regular PWM or
     DAC mode.
     Each bit corresponds to a PWM channel & represents whether DAC mode
     is enabled for that channel.

   default: 0
