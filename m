Coming back to this; there's a bit of an anomaly with the 0x01 Power
Down pin for at least one platform.Â  As listed above, the OV2680 on one
of my platforms has 3 GPIOs defined, and the table above gives them as
type Reset, Power down and Clock enable. I'd assumed from this table
that "power down" meant a powerdown GPIO (I.E. the one usually called
PWDNB in Omnivision datasheets and "powerdown" in drivers), but the
datasheet for the OV2680 doesn't list a separate reset and powerdown
pin, but rather a single pin that performs both functions.


Am I wrong to treat that as something that ought to be mapped as a
powerdown GPIO to the sensors? Or do you know of any other way to
reconcile that discrepancy?


Failing that; the only way I can think to handle this is to register
proxy GPIO pins assigned to the sensors as you suggested previously, and
have them toggle the GPIO's assigned to the INT3472 based on platform
specific mapping data (I.E. we register a pin called "reset", which on
most platforms just toggles the 0x00 pin, but on this specific platform
would drive both 0x00 and 0x01 together. We're already heading that way
for the regulator consumer supplies so it's sort of nothing new, but I'd
still rather not if it can be avoided.
