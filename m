"until it decide to not try it again" is not how the kernel's EPROBE_DEFER
mechanism works. It will queue a new re-probe of all devices on the
deferred probe list whenever another driver's probe() method succeeds.

So once i801_probe() returns success, the dell-smo8800 driver's probe()
will be tried again and at that point the i2c-i801 i2c_adapter exists
and it will succeed.

Yes the dell-smo8800 driver's probe() may be called multiple times
before i801_probe(), but that is not an issue.

It is guaranteed that the dell-smo8800 driver's probe() will be called
at least once after i801_probe() succeeds.

EPROBE_DEFER is used in other cases on x86 platforms too and it is
used a whole lot on ARM platforms. If you consider EPROBE_DEFER
fundamentally broken then that is a whole other discussion and
frankly that is out of scope for this discussion. EPROBE_DEFER
is a widely used and proven mechanism. Arguing that this patch
cannot move forward because EPROBE_DEFER has generic issues really
is out of scope.

My remark about many modules having bugs in their remove() path
was to counter your argument that people do manual rmmod-s all
the time.

But how many people do or do not do manual rmmods is not
the fundamental point here.

The fundamental point is that if users make manual rmmod calls then
they already need to also manually undo the results of the rmmod call.
So now they will also need to reload dell-smo8800 driver as part of
the manual undoing. I really don't see a problem with that. Users
should not be unloading (and 99% is not unloading) the i2c-i801 driver
in the first place.

My patch series adds support for probing the i2c-address to make it
easier for users to check what the address of the lis3lv02d chip
on their laptop model is.

This probing requires access to the actual i2c_adapter which is
a PCI device. So this can only run after the PCI-driver for the
i2c-i801 bus has bound, which means after the probe() from the
PCI driver so it cannot be __init code.

Pali I'm getting the feeling that you have dug in your heels that:

1. Current approach is good
2. Hans' new approach is bad

And that you are not really given my arguments why moving
the code out of the i2c-i801 driver is a good idea a fair hearing.

I would like you to try and take some distance from this and
look at this with more of a helicopter view.

As I mentioned earlier in the thread and as Andy has agreed
with my main motivation for moving the handling of the i2c_client
instantation is that this is a SMO88xx ACPI device specific kludge
and as such IMHO thus belongs in the driver for the SMO88xx ACPI
platform_device.

Had I been involved in (and have the knowledge of kernel internals
I have now) the original i2c-i801.c SMO88xx ACPI device changes
then I would likely have nacked them.

Putting this sort of highly device specific code into generic
drivers like the i2c-i801 code does not scale. What if tomorrow
we find some other ACPI device with similar issues are we then
going to add yet another kludge to the generic shared i2c-i801 code ?

Also note that the i2c-i801.c code already is triggered by
the presence of certain ACPI hw-ids and we already have a
mechanism to only load code based on ACPI hw-ids (1), that is
have a platform_driver with an acpi_match table for those ids,
which is exactly the mechanism my new approach is using.

From a design perspective the handling of all of this
*very obviously* belongs in a driver actually binding to
these ACPI ids and my suggested changes are actually
following this, what IMHO is the only proper way to handle
this.

Now if there were big problems with my suggested approach
then I could understand your reluctance.

But the only real problem you have pointed out is that
if people *manually* rmmod i2c-i801 that then after *manually*
modprobing i2c-i801 again the i2c_client for the lis3lv02d chip
is not automatically re-instated, instead they will need to
also manually reload the dell-smo8800 driver. Which IMHO
really is not an issue since they are already manually messing
with drivers anyways.

And note that even that problem could be fixed by using
bus-notifiers as Andy suggested. IMHO using notifiers here is
overkill. But if you are ok with moving this code out of i2c-i801
and intel dell-smo8800 if I use notifiers in the next version so
that things will keep working even after a *manual* rmmod of
i2c-i801 then I'll do so for v3 of the patchset.

Regards,

Hans


1) The fact alone that the old approach requires manually
syncing the 2 copies of the ACPI hw-id tables already
indicates that the i2c-i801 code is not the right place
for this functionality.
