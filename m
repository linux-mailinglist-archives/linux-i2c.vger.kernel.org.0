And it is required to bind lis3 device to ACPI code? What is needed is
just to check if system matches DMI strings and ACPI strings. You are
not binding device to DMI strings, so I think there is no need to bind
it neither to ACPI strings.

Yes, I know it.

Ok, this makes sense. Anyway, is explicit void* cast and L suffix

Ok, then let that table as you have it now.
