Okay, I can change the name if the 'aspeed,hw-timeout-ms' is
inappropriate but I still doubt using of 'bus-timeout-ms'.

The 'bus-timeout-ms' is being used for some client drivers in hwmon
subsystem but it's not being used for any adapter driver currently.
Since adapter drivers also use timeout value which I2C core provides,
it could make confusion with it if I use 'bus-timeout-ms' for an adapter
node in DT. Though, I and Wolfram agreed last year that the adapter
timeout property can't be added into DT because it's purely S/W property
so using of 'bus-timeout-ms' in DT for H/W property setting of an
adapter device could be acceptable if we make consensus here.

Please share your thoughts or suggest a better name for it.

Thanks,

Jae
