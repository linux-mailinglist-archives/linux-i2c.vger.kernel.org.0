Absolutely agree that would the way to go if people want to support my
crazy.

However, that will leave the input clock frequency unknown which means we'll
program a garbage value into one of the device registers. Doesn't matter
to me, but not good in general.

This is avoiding for now the questions of:
1) Why devm for a clock we hold for 2 lines of code, none of which
   have an error return path...
2) clk_get_rate() is documented as not guaranteed to do anything for
   a clk until enabled, so this is relying on it being enabled by
   someone else or a quirk of the the chip.

I don't think so, but maybe I'm missing something.
There is a devm_reset_control_get_optional() though, similar to the clock
one that returns a NULL if not present. 

I'll use that here to make this a slightly less ugly hack.
If I can handle clocks nicely using Niyas' work then can revisit
whether the i2c and aspeed maintainers would accept making the
reset optional.
