There's the whole using DT bindings in ACPI bindings thing, but I have 
little interest (or time) in supporting that. Maybe that's what's 
happening here? I haven't looked. The whole concept is flawed IMO. It 
may work for simple cases of key/value device properties, but the ACPI 
model is quite different in how resources are described and managed.
