Do we want to keep lower case for names and surnames? Can I use
upper cases?

The point of using the imperative form is to clearly state what
the patch does. Saying "the supported commands are..." feels a
bit lazy, in my opinion, and requires a peek into the change to
fully understand what the patch introduces.

To be honest, I wouldn't reject the patch over this, but it
doesn't hurt to expand the log a little.

(No need to resendâ€”you can just reply to this mail with your
updated commit log.)

What's the point of adding a feature that no one uses? :-)

No worries, please leave it as it is if you think it will be
useful in the future. I just wanted to clarify.

Thanks,
