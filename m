I'm not a huge fan of this comment, it just says what the code does. It
would be much better to explain *why* the code does what it does.

I realise describing what the code does was already the gist of the
comment and that you're just updating it to match the change to the
code, but that's my entire problem with it. We'd be better off deleting
it if we're not going to explain why the masking is necessary.

I'm not sure why the write was conditional, but I'm not sure that
making it unconditional is valid either? Why the change? Why not add
the extra interrupt bits to the condition in addition to the value mask
for the write?
