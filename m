Why is this limited to probe?

The function actually checks whether or not the ACPI power state of
the device is low-power at the call time (except that it is a bit racy
with respect to _set_power(), so it may not work as expected if called
in parallel with that one).

Maybe drop the "probe" part of the name (actually, I would call this
function acpi_dev_state_low_power()) and add a paragraph about the
potential race with _set_power() to the description?

The above information belongs somewhere else in my view.

"On a system without ACPI, return false.  On a system with ACPI,
return true if the current ACPI power state of the device is not D0,
or false otherwise.

Note that the power state of a device is not well-defined after it has
been passed to acpi_device_set_power() and before that function
returns, so it is not valid to ask for the ACPI power state of the
device in that time frame."

This is (at least) inefficient, because the same check is repeated by
ACPI_COMPANION().

If you really want to print the message, it is better to do something like

struct acpi_device *adev = ACPI_COMPANION(dev);

if (!adev)
        return false;

ret = acpi_device_get_power(adev, &power_state);

And the log level of this message is way too high IMO.

This means a firmware bug AFAICS and so after seeing it once on a
given system it becomes noise.  I'd use pr_debug() to print it.
