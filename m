Note that when I wrote the i2c-pxa recovery code (which was developed
and tested on Armada 3720 - the uDPU) it had to work... when the
suggestion came up to implement generic recovery, I stated:

http://archive.lwn.net:8080/linux-kernel/20200705210942.GA1055@kunai/T/#mf7f862fcd53245f14fb650d33c29cf139d41039d

Yes, indeed. That's because the pinctrl internals get confused. I sent
you an email about it on 6th December 2019

"pinctrl states vs pinmux vs gpio (i2c bus recovery)"

which is why i2c-pxa did things the way it did in my commit
"i2c: pxa: implement generic i2c bus recovery".
