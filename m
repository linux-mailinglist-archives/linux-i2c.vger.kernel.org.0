ok, I missed that the core clocks aren't scaled based on the configured
baudrate. Apparently experience shows that it is not practical due to the
latency issues you mention.

Thanks for the clarification. So if a board wanted to use a higher baudrate
for the console it (currently) shouldn't be a problem. While it would be nice
to have uniform settings for all UARTs it's also not a big deal to have two
values, just wanted to make sure it's needed
