Yes, I agree. That was what I was thinking about - I meant that it is only relevant to callbacks in i2c-mux.c

This is indeed a bigger problem I didn't think about earlier. But at I guess we agree that having such a possibility is
useful, we just have to find out the best way to implement this.

But the problem is that currently the select callback does not have a "trylock" semantics - it tries for quite some time
before giving up. We would need to introduce some kind of flag to distinguish between the two. But the caller then would
have to most likely implement his own timeout loop which is not elegant solution either.

That would be ok for me but Wolfram would have to comment, I guess.

I'm not sure how useful this is for generic case (if it's "most" or only "some") but as you pointed out, it is not a
simple extension of a lock as now the client would have to deal with the fail possibility so I think such a lock should
still be considered an opt-in. For this, a new API is good idea.

Something like this was my initial idea. But I'm not that sure if such a "deeper lock" should indeed be default option
for all callers. Could that introduce some regressions? Especially if we somehow get deselected automatically by the
device (like noted below).

Also there is a possibility that a mux could be deselected after some idle time as well. I think the PCA9461 does
support something like that but I would have to check.

Maybe a hybrid approach would be best, then? The user could provide a flag to i2c_bus_lock() to opt-in for a deeper lock
(to avoid possible regressions and changed behavior) but the actual select would be called in __i2c_mux_mater_xfer and
deselect in unlock_bus as you suggested above (but only if the flag was provided to i2c_bus_{un,}lock(). I'm not sure if
this is better than introducing i2c_{un,}lock_select_bus() as suggested previously, however. Wolfram, what are your
thoughts? I think an additional point of view would be useful here.
