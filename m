Great, thanks for the review.

To be honest I was surprised that you were able to reproduce the resume
bug with QEMU in the first place. I did not remember about commit
a9c8088c7988e.

My understanding of the PM subsystem is fairly limited (it evolves
faster than my leaning curve I'm afraid) but you are most certainly
right on that.

Reverting a9c8088c7988e would make run-time PM inefficient again, so I
am opposed to doing that. Flag DPM_FLAG_NO_DIRECT_COMPLETE seems to
have been introduced for exactly this purpose, so I would just use
that. To be honest I don't really understand why it is not the default,
but again I don't know much about the PM subsystem.
