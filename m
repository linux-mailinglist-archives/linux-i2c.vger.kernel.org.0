I don't really know but I can mke some asumptions.

Maybe the link involved in the issue is created quite early in the overlay
applying process, before the calls to the of notifier of_i2c_notify() that
can clear the FWNODE_FLAG_NOT_DEVICE.

The link is created by of_link_to_phandle(). This functions is triggered
from of_fwnode_add_links() which is the .add_link() operation of the OF
fwnode_operations.

The operation is called by fw_devlink_parse_fwnode(), itself triggered by
fw_devlink_link_device() each time device_add() is called.

If the device_add() related to the reg_dock_sys_3v3 is called before the
of_i2c_notify() related to tca6424_dock_1, the FWNODE_FLAG_NOT_DEVICE flag
in tca6424_dock_1 is not cleared when of_link_to_phandle() is called.

Does this scenario make sense ?

This is the Microchip Lan966x PCI device use case.
The Lan966x is a component that can be a "standard" SoC (i.e. core CPUs
and some peripherals) or as a PCI device.
When in PCI device mode, the core CPUs are not available and are replaced
by an endpoint PCI. The PCI host in PCI device mode has to act the code CPUs
in SoC mode. In other word the PCI host has access to peripherals (PCI MMIO
accesses) and has to handle each peripherals.

Drivers for these peripherals are already available in the kernel (reset
controller, i2c controller, network switch, clock controllers, ...) and are
functional when the Lan966x is in SoC mode.

In order to re-use all of these drivers, the solution was to have a Lan966x
PCI driver that is probe() matching the Lan966x PCI Vendor/Device ID.
This driver then load a DT overlay to described the Lan966x internal components.

Basically, the base DT (the DT describing the PCI host board) has the PCI nodes
between the root PCI node and the Lan966x PCI device built at runtime during the
PCI bus scan. At the end of the scan, the Lan966x driver load the overlay and
the final DT looks like the following:
--- 8< ---
soc {
	...
	pcie@d0070000 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-pcie";
		...
		/* A bridge, created at runtime during PCI scan */
		pci@0,0 {
			compatible = "pci11ab,100\0pciclass,060400\0pciclass,0604";
			...

			/* The Lan966x PCI device, created at runtime during PCI scan */
			dev@0,0 { 
				compatible = "pci1055,9660\0pciclass,020000\0pciclass,0200";
				...

				/*
				 * This node is added by the overlay
				 * during lan966x PCI driver probe()
				 */
				pci-ep-bus@0 {
					compatible = "simple-bus";
					...

					flx0: flexcom@e0040000 {
						compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-flexcom";
						reg = <0xe0040000 0x100>;
						ranges = <0x0 0xe0040000 0x800>;
						...			

						i2c_lan966x: i2c@600 {
							compatible = "microchip,lan966x-i2c";
							reg = <0x600 0x200>;
							...
						};
					};
					...
				};
			};
		};
	};
};
--- 8< ---

Without clearing FWNODE_FLAG_NOT_DEVICE, a link is created between
i2c@600 and dev@0,0.
With the FWNODE_FLAG_NOT_DEVICE cleared in device_add(), the link is
created between i2c@600 and pci-ep-bus@0.

flexcom@e0040000 is a MFD device.

In the lan966x PCI driver, the overlay is applied using the following:
--- 8< ---

static int lan966x_pci_load_overlay(struct lan966x_pci *data)
{
	u32 dtbo_size = __dtbo_lan966x_pci_end - __dtbo_lan966x_pci_begin;
	void *dtbo_start = __dtbo_lan966x_pci_begin;
	int ret;

	ret = of_overlay_fdt_apply(dtbo_start, dtbo_size, &data->ovcs_id,
				   data->dev->of_node);
	if (ret)
		return ret;

	return 0;
}

static int lan966x_pci_probe(struct pci_dev *pdev,
			     const struct pci_device_id *id)
{
	struct device *dev = &pdev->dev;
	struct lan966x_pci *data;
	...
	data->dev = dev;
	...
	ret = lan966x_pci_load_overlay(data);
	if (ret)
		return ret;

	...
	ret = of_platform_default_populate(dev->of_node, NULL, dev);
	if (ret)
		goto err_unload_overlay;

	return 0;
	...
}
--- 8< ---

Hope my explanations were clear enough and answered your question.
Feel free to ask some more details if needed.

I provided only extractions of the full dtso file. If you need some more
information (all nodes, all properties) feel free to ask.

Best regards,
