Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Mr Aalam Abdalah, the head of audits at UBA (United Bank for
Africa) Burkina Faso. On a routine audit check last month, I
discovered a

dormant investment account which was opened in 1997 belonging to a
foreigner who died on-board the crashed Egypt Air Flight 990

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EgyptAir_Flight_990) in 1999. My
records show that every effort made by the bank to track any member of
his family

or any one as the next of kin has since failed because the deceased
died leaving no heir or a will in his file. I have decided to contact
you in

my bid to locate a matured and trustworthy partner to stand as the next of kin.

I intend to facilitate the transfer of this sum of $12.5Million
Dollars in the Investment Deposit to a safe account overseas. I am
therefore

proposing that you confidentially partner with me by standing as the
next of kin and provide an account or set up a new one that will serve
the

purpose of receiving this fund. For your assistance in this venture, I
am ready to part with a good percentage of the entire funds. After
going

through the deceased person's records filed in our office, I
discovered that no one has operated this account since 1999 till date
and he died

without a heir; no one has come forward for this claim, hence the
money has been floating.

The information I have on this account is privileged and confidential
as no other person has access to this. If we do not act fast and
urgently,

it would be forfeited and subsequently converted to state funds which
may benefit only the shareholders of the bank. This money can be
approved

to you legally and with all the necessary documentary approvals in
your name. However, you would be required to show some proof of claim
which I

will provide you with and also guide you on how to make your applications.

Please do give me a response through my private email so that I can
send you detailed information on the modalities of my proposition. I

completely trust you to keep this proposition absolutely confidential.

I look forward to your prompt response.

Best Regards,
Aalam Abdalah
