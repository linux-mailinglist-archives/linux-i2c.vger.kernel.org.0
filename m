Okay, I was always under impression that DT has at least one nice feature in
comparison with ACPI that it can be replaced / updated in much quicker /
independent manner. What you are telling seems like the same issue that
ACPI-based platforms have. However, there they usually put all possible devices
into DSDT and firmware enables them via run-time (ACPI) variables. Are you
trying to implement something similar here?

Perhaps it needs to be summarised to cover at least this question along with
the above?
