Got your point, and in contrast to what you wrote, according to the I2C
spec, a master is required ("must") to restart the transaction in case
the arbitration is lost.

From I2C-bus specification and user manual [1], 3.1.8 Arbitration:

```
No information is lost during the arbitration process. A controller that loses the arbitration
can generate clock pulses until the end of the byte in which it loses the arbitration and
must restart its transaction when the bus is free.
```

In case there is a different view from the one Oleksij expressed here,
let me know and I can improve the commit message, otherwise I guess
we can just drop this change.
