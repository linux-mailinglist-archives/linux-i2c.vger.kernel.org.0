Code flow from console driver probe(qcom_geni_serial.c)

uart_add_one_port--->uart_configure_port--->{ 1) uart_change_pm(enable 
console resources)Â  2)register_console(boot to real console switch 
happens here)}

Console resources are not disabled from anywhere before the switch 
happens completely. I meant to say until we saw below logs.

[    3.875692] printk: bootconsole [qcom_geni0] disabled

I think the board reset issue cannot occur during the window where early 
console and 'real' console coexist.

I have validated proposed solution by me, it is working fine.

Currently voting is done for every QUP and not only to which earlycon is 
connect, with the above approach we can't remove vote from other QUPs.

However we can limit voting only to earlycon QUP by removing 
interconnect from DT node of other QUPs.

I am not sure how clean is this solution.

How about if we limit voting only to earlycon QUP by removing 
interconnect from DT node of other QUPs.?

If there is no real console then earlyconsole should work until clk 
driver disables unvoted SE clocks.

Yes, early console depends on bootloader to enable neccessary resources 
for it. I guess currently Coreboot console driver is doing that.

Yes that is correct. We can't support earlyconsole for long without 
having a real console.
