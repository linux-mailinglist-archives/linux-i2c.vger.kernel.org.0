But point of this typedefing is to hide real type and let user to use
this "unknown" type without excepting any specific type.

"Therefore compiler is happy" here is there just a "hack" which
currently mute casting warning. But I think it is not something which
should be used as it is against how API / code of specific function was
designed.

For me this situation looks like: Somebody created API and specified how
to use it. It was realized that specified usage is not ideal for some
operations. And then people started "hacking" this API to look better
in these special cases.

But solution for this issue is to fix API (or create a new API which
better for this purpose), not hacking or workarounding it to looks
better by hiding / workarounding other important details.

But in this case you really should not avoid casting. It is different
pointer type of unknown (or rather hidden) type. Currently it does not
throw warning (maybe because compiler is not smart enough). But it does
not mean that code is really semantically correct or that in future
compiler (or its new version) does not throw warning.

Syntactically code looks better, but only until reader start studding
what code is really doing.

I understand your concerns and also your motivation. API is not ideal
for usage. But both current and your proposed solution is just a hack to
workaround this API usage.

I think that according to C standard it is possible to cast between
pointer and non-pointer (integer-like) types only via uintptr_t (or
intptr_t) type...

So compliant C code could look like this?

    void func(void **ret) {
        *ret = (void *)(uintptr_t)1;
    }

    bool test(void) {
        void *found = (uintptr_t)0;
        func(&found);
        return (uintptr_t)found;
    }

or test() function may be simplified:

    bool test(void) {
        void *found = NULL;
        func(&found);
        return found;
    }

(but for me it looks strange if I'm reading _word_ NULL when used as a
false value in 2-state logic variable)

Yes, of course, this is fully valid.
