huh. First consider IRQF_EARLY_RESUME - it's better, but still will be a hack

regulator is passive device, somebody should call it !?

And da9211-regulator IRQ handler should remain disabled till resume_device_irqs() call.

note. regulator_class implements only

static const struct dev_pm_ops __maybe_unused regulator_pm_ops = {
	.suspend	= regulator_suspend,
	.resume		= regulator_resume,
};
