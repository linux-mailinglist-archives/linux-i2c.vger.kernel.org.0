To: Managing Director, 

Good Morning Sir,
How is India today and did you get my previous message?
Some products required by our company were recently found to be cheaper in India.
Most importantly, I want to introduce you to our company board of directors, to enable you supply these products to our company from India, with very good profits and commissions.
Please note that your present job type or business does not matter to supply these products to our company from India.
Kindly respond back with your direct telephone or whatsapp number, for details.
Procurement, GCAP Supplies
