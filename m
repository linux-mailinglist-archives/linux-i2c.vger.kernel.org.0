Even before reading this my attention was on option 2 as well.
However, we might give another round of searching the documentation
for the vGPIO lines.

Meanwhile, have you tried to see if Android tree(s) has(ve) the
patches related to all this? (I'm a bit sceptical they do the right
thing and most probably just fall into board files case)
