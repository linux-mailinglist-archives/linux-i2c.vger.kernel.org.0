I would agree about throwing a warning message in retry case.

Not sure how would it affect other i2c bus drivers using retries > 0. 
Retries might be pretty rare with i2c-imx but some other drivers set 
this to 5 for example. At least using _ratelimited printk is a must 
using this approach.

I wouldn't say this is exactly a workaround if "retries mechanism" is 
standard part of the i2c core. Other drivers use it as well. it is just 
a setting to improve bus robustness.

But OK, I guess we can live with this one-liner in the downstream kernel.
