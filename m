Yes, the serializer and the remote peripheral i2c aliases can be 
dynamically reserved at runtime, so the i2c-alias-pool and the i2c-alias 
are, in that sense, not needed.

I haven't looked at this in depth yet, but reading the references you 
gave, it sounds like it's not quite clear what addresses are available 
and what are not.

On the other hand, is dynamic i2c address reservation something that the 
users expect to happen? All i2c devices I have used have always had a 
fixed address in the DT, even if at times the devices may support 
choosing between a few different addresses.

Keeping with that tradition, would it be best to just use fixed i2c 
aliases, defined in the DT, for the serializers and the remote 
peripherals? In the current series this is already the case for 
serializers (with i2c-alias property), but we could do something similar 
for the remote peripherals.

  Tomi
