My initial work is based on a board that is similar to the APU2, but has additional peripherals connected to the smbus, including a NCT7491 thermal monitor/fan controller and PCA6524 GPIO controller. These are simply peripherals on a board variant, not 'platform' devices, so I didn't want to follow the platform driver approach that the APU2 GPIO driver uses.

SMBus (and I2C) peripherals can generally not be enumerated without some firmware support. It is possible to probe for specific devices on the bus (eg sensors-detect) but in general it is not feasible to let every supported device driver probe the bus for its device. ACPI and Devicetree provides the kernel with metadata for the device: type, address, calibrated set points for temperature, etc.

Since the peripherals are not standard platform devices, they are not described by the ACPI tables provided by Coreboot or AMD, but it's not too difficult to create supplementary device description tables (ACPI) for non-standard devices. These can be added to coreboot, supplied to qemu as additional firmware files (see -acpitable arg), or built into the kernel (see https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/acpi/ssdt-overlays.txt)

ACPI may be an ugly abomination, but it's what we're stuck with on x86 and it can only improve when more people get their hands on it.

You might find it helpful to look at the coreboot source for the APU2 (src/mainboard/pcengines/apu2/gpio_ftns.h)

Would it be awesome if specs were available for every device supported by the kernel? Absolutely, what a dream! Perhaps a separate repo, like the linux-firmware repo, would be better for binary objects that don't change. Unfortunately, copyright makes this hard. NDAs make this hard. Hardware companies just don't seem to work like that.
